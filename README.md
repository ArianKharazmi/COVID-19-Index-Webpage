# COVID-19-Utility-Web-Application
A program that gathers Coronavirus (COVID-19) data and employs its statistics onto an easy-to-understand Streamlit webpage. This is the first version, and is a work-in-progress, it will be further updated as more, major changes are made. This was made to further familiarize myself with the Python language and the Streamlit service. Being in an on-going pandemic, this tool will be useful to view COVID-19 data in an accessible manner for better understanding.
