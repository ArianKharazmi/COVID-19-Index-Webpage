# COVID-19-Utility-Web-Application v1.5(C) (Alpha) 
A program that gathers Coronavirus (COVID-19) data and employs its statistics onto an easy-to-understand Streamlit webpage. This is the first version, and is a work-in-progress, it will be further updated as more, major changes are made. This was made to further familiarize myself with the Python language and the Streamlit service. Being in an on-going pandemic, this tool will be useful to view COVID-19 data in an accessible manner for better understanding.

**This program is in its early stages, please do not take COVID-19 data as accurate for the time being until the program has been properly updated to display that information as accurate.**

- **Streamlit is not yet available with this version, the localized client version of v1.5(C) will work through your IDE but currently there is no Web Application version of 1.5(C), v.1.4.5 is the current version hosted, but this will be updated to reflect the changes soon.**

- **COVID-19-Utility-Web-Application v1.5(C) (Alpha) can run through your IDE (v1.5(C)) or accessed via the Streamlit webpage. (v1.4.5)**

- **There is no input method for the webpage's frontend...yet. User inputs will work through your IDE and console/terminal.**

- **The IDE-Console/Terminal will function as is, the Streamlit web-application is a bit unstable, proceed at your own discretion.**
