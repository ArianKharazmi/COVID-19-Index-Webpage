# COVID-19-Utility-Web-Application
A program that gathers Coronavirus (COVID-19) data and employs its statistics onto an easy-to-understand Streamlit webpage. This is the first version, and is a work-in-progress, it will be further updated as more, major changes are made. This was made to further familiarize myself with the Python language and the Streamlit service. Being in an on-going pandemic, this tool will be useful to view COVID-19 data in an accessible manner for better understanding. 

**This program is in its early stages, please do not take COVID data as accurate for the time being until the program has been properly updated to display that information as accurate.**
